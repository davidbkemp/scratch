        This is Part 2 of a two part series that begins with
        <a href="index.html">Part 1</a>.

<h1>Multiple qubits</h1>
<p>
    <b>Important</b>: There is something really important I feel the need to emphasize
    as we start dealing with multiple qubits.
</p>
<p>The blue disks introduced in Part 1 do <em>not</em> correspond to single qubits.</p>
<p>
    <b>Each blue disk corresponds to a distinct state of the entire quantum system.</b>
    <span class="help">
    The blue disks are technically called state &ldquo;amplitudes&rdquo;
    and are represented mathematically using complex numbers.

<h1>Controlled NOT</h1>
<p>
    The <em>Controlled NOT</em> operator is a very simple but powerful
    two-qubit operator.
</p>
<p>
    The Controlled NOT operator modifies the state of one qubit (the target qubit)
    based on state of another qubit (the control qubit).
</p>
<p>
    Specifically, <b>the Controlled NOT operator flips the value of the target qubit
    if the control qubit has a value of 1.</b>
</p>
<p>
    For example: If the initial state is &quot;11&quot;,
    and if the left qubit is used as the control qubit,
    and the right qubit is the target,
    then the result will be &quot;10&quot;.
    As usual, we represent this as
    &ldquo;11 &rarr; 10&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
    For the same choice of control and target qubits
    (left qubit as control qubit and right qubit as target):
</p>
<ul>
    <li>00 &rarr; 00 (i.e. no effect)</li>
    <li>01 &rarr; 01 (i.e. no effect)</li>
    <li>10 &rarr; 11 (i.e. target bit flips)</li>
    <li>11 &rarr; 10 (i.e. target bit flips)</li>
</ul>

    <h1>Quantum Entanglement</h1>
    <p>
        A combination of the Hadamard followed by a Controlled NOT
        can put two qubits into a state of &ldquo;quantum entanglement&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
        In what follows, we take a two qubit system in the state &quot;00&quot;,
        apply the Hadamard operation to the left qubit,
        and then use that left qubit as the control in a Controlled NOT
        of the right qubit:
    </p>
    <h2>Initial State</h2>
    <div class="animationBlock">
        <div class="qstate">State: 100% chance of being 00</div>
        <svg id="cnot-0" class="qstateSvg qstateSvg__hideBitLabels"></svg>
    </div>
    <h2>After applying a Hadamard to the left qubit</h2>
    <div class="animationBlock">
        <div class="qstate">State: 50% chance of being 00, and 50% chance of being 10</div>
        <svg id="cnot-1" class="qstateSvg qstateSvg__hideBitLabels"></svg>
    </div>
    <h2>After a Controlled NOT of the right qubit controlled by the left qubit</h2>
    <div class="animationBlock">
        <div class="qstate">State: 50% chance of being 00, and 50% chance of being 11</div>
        <svg id="cnot-2" class="qstateSvg qstateSvg__hideBitLabels"></svg>
    </div>
    <p>
        Note that, if you were to measure the qubits while they are in this state,
        you would find that they are either both 0 or both 1.
    </p>
    <p>
        To really appreciate quantum entanglement,
        we need to introduce another single qubit operator...
    </p>

<h1>Y Rotations</h1>
<p>
    There are three particlar single qubit operators commonly referred to
    as the X, Y, and Z Rotation operators.
    Historically, these refer to physical rotations in
    three dimensional space around the X, Y, and Z axes.
</p>
<p>For this article we will only make use of the Y Rotation operator.</p>
<p>
    Like all the rotation operators,
    <b>you need to specify how many degrees of rotation you want applied.</b>
</p>
<p>
    A 90&deg; Y rotation is a little bit like a Hadamard:
    It transforms a pure 0 state (or pure 1 state)
    into an equal super-position of 0 and 1.
</p>
<p>
    A 180&deg; Y rotation is a little bit like a NOT:
    it flips a 0 into a 1 and a 1 into 0
    except that, when flipping from 1 to 0,
    it also flips the phase.
</p>
<p>
    As expected, two 90&deg; Y rotations gives a 180&deg; Y rotation etc.
    Strangely, a 360&deg; Y rotation,
    while leaving a 0 state as 0 (and a 1 state as 1),
    it actually flips the phase.
</p>
<p>Try out the Y Rotation operator below 45&deg; at a time.</p>
<div class="animationBlock">
    <div class="animationBlock_buttons">
        <div>
            <button id="yRotationButton">Y Rotation By 45&deg;</button>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="qstate">State: <span id="yRotationQState"></span></div>
    <svg id="yRotationSvg" class="qstateSvg qstateSvg__hideBitLabels"></svg>
</div>
</section>

<section>
<h1>Did you notice?</h1>
<p>
    Did you notice that a 45&deg; Y rotation of a 0 state
    resulted in a state with a 85% chance of 0
    and 15% chance of 1?
    This will become important later.
</p>
<p>
    Given that 45&deg; is half of 90&deg;,
    and given that a 90&deg; Y rotation of a 0 state
    results in a state with a 50% chance of 0 and 50% chance of 1,
    you might have expected a 45&deg; Y rotation to take you half way:
    i.e. 75% chance of a 0 and 25% chance of a 1.
</p>

<p>
    But that is not how rotations work.
    If you rotate a circle by 90&deg;,
    the bottom of the circle will be rotated to a height halfway up to the top.
    But if you only rotate it by 45&deg;,
    the bottom of the circle will be rotated to a height significantly less
    than a quarter of the height of the circle.
    <span class="help">
        The quantum mechanics of Y Rotations actually means that
        a rotation by &theta; of a 0 state results in a state with
        a cos<sup>2</sup>(&theta;) chance of remaining 0
        and a sin<sup>2</sup>(&theta;) of becoming a 1.
