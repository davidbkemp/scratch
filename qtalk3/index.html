    <h1>Quantum Computers?</h1>
    <p>You have probably heard of quantum computers.</p>
    <p>You have probably heard that they are faster than conventional computers.</p>
    <p>Perhaps you have heard of quantum bits, or qubits.</p>
    <p>
        Maybe you have even heard of the puzzling notion that qubits can
        have the values 0 and 1 both
        <em>at the same time</em>.
    </p>
    <p>Let me try to explain what this really means.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h1>Conventional Bits</h1>
    <p>I assume you know what binary bits are.</p>
    <p>
        For instance, 110 is binary for six.
        <span class="help">
            See
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number">Wikipedia</a>
            for more about binary numbers.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p>
        Conventional bits are represented using many different approaches:
        e.g. using two different voltages on a wire,
        points on a magnetic disk magnetized in different directions,
        pulses of light on a glass fibre,
        etc. etc.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h1>Qubits</h1>
    <p>Just like bits, qubits have a binary state.</p>
    <p>
        Qubits use quantum phenomenon like
        the nuclear spin direction of individual atoms.
    </p>
    <p>
        e.g. use &ldquo;clockwise&rdquo; for 0 and &ldquo;anti clockwise&rdquo; for 1.
        <span class="help">
            Conventionally called &ldquo;spin up&rdquo; and &ldquo;spin down&rdquo;.
            Quantum spin is a bit like spinning things in the classical world,
            but has some very important differences we will touch on in a moment.
        </span>
    </p>

        <div class="labelledImage">
            <img src="spinDown.jpg" alt="Spin Down" class="nuclearSpin"/>
            <div class="labelledImage_label nuclearSpinLabel">0</div>
        </div>
        <div class="labelledImage">
            <img src="spinUp.jpg" alt="Spin Up" class="nuclearSpin"/>
            <div class="labelledImage_label nuclearSpinLabel">1</div>
        </div>
    </figure>
</section>

<section>
    <h1>The NOT operator</h1>
    <p>
        Consider the conventional NOT (or bit-flip) operator.
        <span class="help">
            1 and 0 can represent logical <em>true</em> and <em>false</em>.
            NOT <em>true</em> is <em>false</em>, and NOT <em>false</em> is <em>true</em>.
            And so, NOT of 1 is 0, and NOT of 0 is 1.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p>For example, performing a NOT operation on the right most bit of the binary number 111 results in 110.</p>
    <p>In what follows, it will be convenient to represent state of a system by listing all possible states and placing a blue disk next to the current state.</p>
    <p>
        Click the button labelled &ldquo;<em>Not bit<sub>a</sub>&rdquo;</em>
        to apply the NOT operation to the left bit,
        and click the button labelled &ldquo;<em>Not bit<sub>b</sub>&rdquo;</em>
        to apply the NOT operation to the right bit:
    </p>
    <div class="animationBlock">
        <div class="animationBlock_buttons">
            <div>
                <button id="notExampleNot1Button">Not bit<sub>a</sub></button>
                <button id="notExampleNot0Button">Not bit<sub>b</sub></button>
            </div>
            <div>
                <button id="notExampleResetButton">Reset</button>
            </div>
        </div>

        <svg id="notExampleSvg" class="qstateSvg"></svg>
    </div>
</section>

<section>
    <h1>Random NOT</h1>
    <p><em>Random NOT</em>: A NOT operator that has a specified chance of flipping a bit.</p>
    <p>Although not very common, it is still just a classical (non-quantum) operator.</p>
    <p>
        Consider applying a &ldquo;Random NOT&rdquo; twice to a bit whose initial value is 0,
        where the NOT has, for instance, a 30% chance of flipping the bit.
        What is the probability of the final state being 0?
    </p>
    <p>There are two paths leading to a final state of 0:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>0 &rarr; 0 &rarr; 0 with probability of 0.7 x 0.7 = 0.49</li>
        <li>0 &rarr; 1 &rarr; 0 with probability of 0.3 x 0.3 = 0.09</li>
    </ul>
    <p>And so the final state will be 0 with a probability of 49% + 9% = 58%</p>

    <h1>Random NOT (animated)</h1>
    <p>Next we provide an interactive animation of the Random NOT operator.</p>
    <p>The blue disk now splits in two so that we can track the different possible outcomes.</p>
    <p>The probability of being in a state is represented by the radius of the disk.</p>
    <p>Press the &ldquo;Random NOT&rdquo; button multiple times and note how the arrows add head to tail.</p>

<h1>Measurement</h1>
    <p>
        When a conventional computer has various probabilities
        of being in different states,
        e.g. because of random NOT operations,
        it is of course in reality in only one of those states.
        We just don't know which one.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you peek at the system to determine its actual state,
        then the probabilities all <em>collapse</em>
        so that one state has a probability of 1,
        and all the others have a probability of 0.
    </p>
    <p>
        Remember, the larger the blue disk,
        the more likely the system will turn out to be in that state.
    </p>
    <p>
        In quantum computing,
        the word <em>meausurement</em> refers to this act of peeking.
    </p>
    <p>
        Press the &ldquo;Random NOT&rdquo; button multiple times
        and then press the &ldquo;measurement&rdquo; button.
    </p>
    <p><small>Note that there is still nothing quantum mechanical about this yet.</small></p>

<h1>Hadamard of 0</h1>

<h1>Phase</h1>
<p>
    Confused?
    You should be if this is all new to you. 
    Please hang in there for a while longer.
</p>
<p>
    The arrow directions represent what physicists call <em>phase</em>:
    <ul>
        <li>it is an abstract concept of quantum mechanics.</li>
        <li>it has no real classical interpretation.</li>
        <li>it can only be measured indirectly.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    In the case of nuclear spin,
    phases can be manipulated by applying electric and/or
    magnetic fields.
</p>
<p>
    We will see the importance of phase in a moment,
    but first let's look at another interesting quantum computing operator...

<h1>Measurement Revisted</h1>
    <p>Recall:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Measurement causes the system to collapse to a single state.</li>
        <li>The larger the blue disk, the more likely the system will collapse to that state.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Important:</b> Phases do not directly effect the outcome of measurements. i.e. measurements are not affected by arrow directions.</p>

<h1>Quantum Interference</h1>
    <p>Let's apply the Hadamard Operation to a complicated state.</p>
    <p>Now things get extremely weird.</p>
    <p>This is what physicists loose sleep over...</p>
    <p>
        The arrows still add head to tail.
        <span class="help">
            For the maths to work,
            the arrow lengths now have to represent
            the square root of the probabilty.
            We will briefly cover this in more detail later.

<h1>Feeling a Bit Lost?</h1>
    <p>
        Study the previous animation carefully.
    </p>
    <p>
        The system starts equally divided between 0 and 1.
        In other words, it is equally likely to be 0 or 1.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Hadamard splits each state into two equally sized components.
        In other words, the Hadamard of 0 is equally likely to be 0 or 1,
        and the Hadamard of 1 is equally likely to be 0 or 1.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>So we should expect the final result to also be
        equally divided between 0 and 1.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        But adding the arrows together in this particular example
        results in one state having a much higher probability than the other.

    <h1>Totally confused?</h1>
    <blockquote>
        If quantum mechanics hasn't profoundly shocked you, you haven't understood it yet.
        <br />
        <em>Neils Bohr</em>
    </blockquote>
</section>

<section>
    <h1>Please explain?</h1>

    <p>
        I am assuming that most of you are still confused,
        and so let us spend a little more time on the Hadamard example.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Suppose you took a peek at the state of the system before
        each application of the Hadamard operation.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Each time you peeked, the system would collapse to being entirely
        in the 1 state or the 0 state.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Regardless of whether the qubit is a 1 or a 0,
        the Hadamard would then split the state evenly between 0 and 1,
        with the arrow direction sometimes being flipped.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        If you measure the qubit again after the Hadamard
        you would have an equal chance of finding a 1 or a 0.
        And so, if you measure before each Hadamard, then
        the Hadamard degenerates into a simple random NOT operator.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the interactive example below,
        apply the Hadamard multiple times without measurement
        and note the effects of interference.
    </p>
    <p>
        Repeat, but measure between each Hadamard.

        But it doesn't really get interesting until you have more than one qubit

    <p>
        You can't do anything very interesting with one qubit except perhaps use it to model

<h1>Multiple bits</h1>
<p><b>Important</b>: The blue disks do <em>not</em> correspond to single qubits.</p>
<p>Each blue disk corresponds to a distinct state of the entire quantum system.</p>
<p>
    The blue disks are technically called state &ldquo;amplitudes&rdquo;
    and are represented using complex numbers.
