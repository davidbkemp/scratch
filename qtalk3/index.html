    <h1>Quantum Computers?</h1>
    <p>Heard of quantum computers?</p>
    <p>Heard that they are faster than conventional computers?</p>
    <p>Perhaps you have heard of quantum bits (abbreviated to qubits).</p>
    <p>
        Maybe you have even heard of the puzzling notion that
        <b>qubits can have the values 0 and 1
        <em>both at the same time</em></b>.
    </p>
    <p>Let me try to explain what this really means.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h1>Conventional Bits</h1>
    <p>I assume you know what binary bits are.</p>
    <p>
        For instance, 110 is binary for six.
        <span class="help">
            See
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number">Wikipedia</a>
            for more about binary numbers.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p>
        Conventional bits are represented using many different approaches:
        e.g. using two different voltages on a wire,
        points on a magnetic disk magnetized in different directions,
        pulses of light on a glass fibre,
        etc. etc.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h1>Qubits</h1>
    <p>Just like bits, qubits have a binary state.</p>
    <p>
        <b>Qubits represent 0 and 1 using quantum phenomenon like
        the nuclear spin direction of individual atoms</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        e.g. use &ldquo;clockwise&rdquo; for 0 and &ldquo;anti clockwise&rdquo; for 1.
        <span class="help">
            Conventionally called &ldquo;spin up&rdquo; and &ldquo;spin down&rdquo;.
            Quantum spin is a bit like spinning things in the classical world,
            but has some very important differences we will touch on in a moment.
        </span>
    </p>

        <div class="labelledImage">
            <img src="spinDown.jpg" alt="Spin Down" class="nuclearSpin"/>
            <div class="labelledImage_label nuclearSpinLabel">0</div>
        </div>
        <div class="labelledImage">
            <img src="spinUp.jpg" alt="Spin Up" class="nuclearSpin"/>
            <div class="labelledImage_label nuclearSpinLabel">1</div>
        </div>
    </figure>
</section>

<section>
    <h1>The NOT operator</h1>
    <p>
        Consider the conventional NOT (or bit-flip) operator.
        <span class="help">
            1 and 0 can represent logical <em>true</em> and <em>false</em>.
            NOT <em>true</em> is <em>false</em>, and NOT <em>false</em> is <em>true</em>.
            And so, NOT of 1 is 0, and NOT of 0 is 1.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p>For example, performing a NOT operation on the right most bit of the binary number 111
    <b>flips the target bit</b> and results in 110.</p>
    <p>In what follows, it will be convenient to represent the state of a system by listing all possible states and placing a blue disk next to the current state.</p>
    <p>
        Click the button labelled &ldquo;<em>Not bit<sub>a</sub>&rdquo;</em>
        to apply the NOT operation to the left bit,
        and click the button labelled &ldquo;<em>Not bit<sub>b</sub>&rdquo;</em>
        to apply the NOT operation to the right bit:

    <h1>Random NOT</h1>
    <p><em>Random NOT</em>: A NOT operator that has a specified chance of flipping a bit.</p>
    <p>Although not very common, it is still <b>just a classical (non-quantum) operator</b>.</p>
    <p>
        Consider applying a &ldquo;Random NOT&rdquo; twice to a bit whose initial value is 0,
        where the NOT has, for instance, a 30% chance of flipping the bit.
        What is the probability of the final state being 0?
    </p>
    <p>
        There are a couple of possible scenarios.
        For instance, the first Random NOT might flip the bit from 0 to 1,
        and the second Random NOT might flip the bit back to 0.
        We represent this as:
    </p>
    <p>
        0 &rarr; 1 &rarr; 0
    </p>
    <p>There are two paths leading to a final state of 0:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            0 &rarr; 0 &rarr; 0 with probability of 0.7 x 0.7 = 0.49
        </li>
        <li>
            0 &rarr; 1 &rarr; 0 with probability of 0.3 x 0.3 = 0.09
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>And so the final state will be 0 with a probability of 49% + 9% = 58%</p>

    <h1>Random NOT (your turn)</h1>
    <p>Next we provide an interactive animation of the Random NOT operator.</p>
    <p>The blue disk now splits in two so that we can track the different possible outcomes.</p>
    <p>The probability of being in a state is represented by the radius of the disk.</p>

        Press the &ldquo;Random NOT&rdquo; button multiple times and
        <b>note how the arrows add head to tail</b>.

<h1>Measurement</h1>
    <p>
        We have seen how a random NOT operator can
        cause a conventional computer to have various probabilities
        of being in different states.
        Of course
        <b>in reality it is in only one of those states</b>.
        We just don't know which one.
        Strangely, this is an assumpution about reality that we will need to reconsider
        later in this article.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you peek at the system to determine its actual state,
        then the probabilities all <em>collapse</em>
        so that one state has a probability of 1,
        and all the others have a probability of 0.
    </p>
    <p>
        Remember, the larger the blue disk,
        the more likely the system will turn out to be in that state.
    </p>
    <p>
        In quantum computing,
        the word <em>meausurement</em> refers to this act of peeking.
    </p>
    <p>
        Press the &ldquo;Random NOT&rdquo; button multiple times
        and then press the &ldquo;measurement&rdquo; button.
    </p>
    <p><small>
        Note that there is still nothing quantum mechanical about this yet.

<h1>Hadamard of 0</h1>
    <p>The Hadamard is a special <em>quantum</em> operator that can be applied to qubits.</p>

        <b>Warning:</b> this first look at quantum operators will be pretty boring.
        I promise it will get exciting soon.
    </p>
    <p>As you will see below, the Hadamard initially seems like a Random NOT with 50% chance of success.</p>
    <p><small>
        In this interactive example,
        I purposely disable the Hadamard button after you press it.
        Later in this article we will see what happens when you apply the Hadamard twice in a row.

<h1>Phase</h1>
<p>
    Confused?
    You should be if this is all new to you. 
    Please hang in there for a while longer.
</p>
<p>
    The arrow directions represent what physicists call <em>phase</em>:
    <ul>
        <li>it is an abstract concept of quantum mechanics.</li>
        <li>it has no &ldquo;common sense&rdquo; interpretation.</li>
        <li>it can <b>only be measured indirectly</b>.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    In the case of nuclear spin,
    phases can be manipulated by applying electric and/or
    magnetic fields.

    We will see the importance of phase in a moment,
    but first let's look at another interesting quantum computing operator...

        <li>The larger the blue disk, the more likely the system will collapse to that state.</li>

<h1>Quantum Interference</h1>

    <p>Consider what happens when we apply a Hadamard operation twice.</p>

    <p>
        Let's assume that a qubit is initially known to definitely be in a 0 state.
        If you were to apply the Hadamard to it twice in a row,
        then there are four equally likely scenarios:
        <span class="help">
            Recall that &ldquo;x &rarr; y &rarr; z&rdquo;
            means &ldquo;the qubit starts with a value x,
            the first Hadamard results in the qubit having the value y,
            and the second Hadamard results in the qubit having the value z&rdquo;.
        </span>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>0 &rarr; 0 &rarr; 0</li>
        <li>0 &rarr; 0 &rarr; 1</li>
        <li>0 &rarr; 1 &rarr; 0</li>
        <li>0 &rarr; 1 &rarr; 1</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
        So the final state should be equally likely to be 0 or 1 but,
        in reality,
        applying the Hadamard operator twice in a row
        always returns the qubit to its original state.
        In our case, where the qubit is initially 0,
        two applications of the Hadamard will result in it being 0 again.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Try it out.
        Press the &ldquo;Apply Hadamard&rdquo; button twice
        and watch it return to being 100% in the 0 state.

    <h1>What is going on here?</h1>
    
    <p>
        The state of the qubit after the first Hadamard
        is a simple combination of both 0 and 1.
   </p>
   <p>
    The second Hadamard is applied to both the 0 and 1 states
    and the results are combined.

      <p>
        <b>The arrows still add head to tail</b>.
        <span class="help">
            For the maths to work,
            the arrow lengths now have to represent
            the square root of the probabilty.

    <h1>Different kinds of uncertainty</h1>
    
    <p>
        We are actually dealing with two different kinds of uncertainty.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        It is possible that a bit, and even a qubit,
        may be in a fixed state of 1 or 0,
        but that you simply do not know which one it is.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, it is also possible for
        a qubit to be in what is called &ldquo;superposition&rdquo;
        of both 1 and 0.
        <b>Such a qubit is neither 0 nor 1, but is somehow a combination of both.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Suppose that you measure a qubit that is in a superposition of 0 and 1,
        but throw away the outcome of the measurement without looking at it.
        The qubit has now transitioned from the second kind of uncertainty (superposition)
        to the first kind of uncertainty (unknown, but definitely 1 or 0).
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <b>A qubit state can even be a mixture of these two kinds of uncertainty.</b>
        Consider applying a Hadamard to
        a qubit that is in a fixed but unknown state of 1 or 0.
        In both cases, the Hadamard will put it into a superposition of 1 and 0 but,
        depending on its initial state,
        the phases of the 1 and 0 states will either point in
        the same or opposite directions.
        I.e. it ends up in a &ldquo;mixture&rdquo; of the two different superpositions.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Our system of blue disks and red arrows cannot be used to represent
        these complicated mixtures of the two kinds of uncertainty.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <b>
            From now on, diagrams containing multiple blue disks will only be used
            to represent superposition.
        </b>
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h1>Peeking between Hadamards</h1>
        
    <p>
        Let's revisit the scenario of applying a Hadamard twice to a qubit initially in a 0 state,
        and look at what happens if we peek at the qubit after the first Hadamard
        but before the second.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        If you peek at the qubit immediately after applying the first Hadamard,
        then the state of the qubit will collapse to being
        definitely a 1 or definitely a 0, with each being equally likely.
        It will remain in that collapsed state until you apply another operation.
        E.g. if you see a 1, then subsequent measurements will continue to
        give a 1 until you apply the next Hadamard.
    </p>
    
    <p><b>Peeking completely destroys the interference effects!</b></p>
        
    <p>
        Having peeked at the qubit after the first Hadamard,
        the qubit state has collapsed to being definitely a 0 or a 1, and so,
        regardless of whether or not it was a 0 or a 1,
        the second Hadamard should result in a state that is also
        equally likely to be a 0 or a 1.

    <h2>After Peeking</h2>
    <p>
        After peeking,
        the qubit state collapses to being definitely a 1 or a 0
        (not a superposition of the two).
        Recall that we are now only using multiple blue disks to
        represent superpositions.
        So here we arbitrarily pretend that the state has collapsed to 1.
        <span class="help">
            I guess we could have drawn two diagrams to capture
            the two possible outcomes,
            but I hope you get the idea anyway.

    <h2>After Second Hadamard</h2>
    <p>
        Now that you have peeked,
        the second Hadamard is now being applied to a definite state instead
        of a superposition of states.
        And so we get another superposition.
    </p>
    <div class="animationBlock">
        <div class="qstate">State: 50% chance of being 0, and 50% chance of being 1</div>
        <svg id="doubleHadamardWithPeeking-3" class="qstateSvg qstateSvg__hideBitLabels"></svg>
    </div>
    
    <p>
        Note that peeking destroyed the interference effects
        and that the final state is equally likely to be a 0 or a 1.
        <span class="help">
            Don't be distracted by the fact that the arrow direction for the 1 state is
            in the opposite direction to that of the 0 state.
            As mentioned earlier,
            the arrow directions have no direct influence on a measurement,
            and so this final state really does have a
            50% chance of being 0, and 50% chance of being 1.

        It gets even more interesting when you have more than one qubit
    </h1>

    <p>
        The quantum weirdness rises to a whole new level when there are two or more qubits interacting.
        This is explored in <a href="part2.html">Part 2</a>.

        If you want to experiment with various single qubit quantum operations first,
        then have a play with the
