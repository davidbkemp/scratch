    <h1>Quantum Computers?</h1>
    <p>You have probably heard of quantum computers.</p>
    <p>You have probably heard that they are faster than conventional computers.</p>
    <p>Perhaps you have heard of quantum bits (abbreviated to qubits).</p>
    <p>
        Maybe you have even heard of the puzzling notion that
        <b>qubits can have the values 0 and 1
        <em>both at the same time</em></b>.
    </p>
    <p>Let me try to explain what this really means.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h1>Conventional Bits</h1>
    <p>I assume you know what binary bits are.</p>
    <p>
        For instance, 110 is binary for six.
        <span class="help">
            See
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number">Wikipedia</a>
            for more about binary numbers.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p>
        Conventional bits are represented using many different approaches:
        e.g. using two different voltages on a wire,
        points on a magnetic disk magnetized in different directions,
        pulses of light on a glass fibre,
        etc. etc.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h1>Qubits</h1>
    <p>Just like bits, qubits have a binary state.</p>
    <p>
        <b>Qubits represent 0 and 1 using quantum phenomenon like
        the nuclear spin direction of individual atoms</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        e.g. use &ldquo;clockwise&rdquo; for 0 and &ldquo;anti clockwise&rdquo; for 1.
        <span class="help">
            Conventionally called &ldquo;spin up&rdquo; and &ldquo;spin down&rdquo;.
            Quantum spin is a bit like spinning things in the classical world,
            but has some very important differences we will touch on in a moment.
        </span>
    </p>
    <figure>
        <div class="labelledImage">
            <img src="spinDown.jpg" alt="Spin Down" class="nuclearSpin"/>
            <div class="labelledImage_label nuclearSpinLabel">0</div>
        </div>
        <div class="labelledImage">
            <img src="spinUp.jpg" alt="Spin Up" class="nuclearSpin"/>
            <div class="labelledImage_label nuclearSpinLabel">1</div>
        </div>
    </figure>

<section>
    <h1>The NOT operator</h1>
    <p>
        Consider the conventional NOT (or bit-flip) operator.
        <span class="help">
            1 and 0 can represent logical <em>true</em> and <em>false</em>.
            NOT <em>true</em> is <em>false</em>, and NOT <em>false</em> is <em>true</em>.
            And so, NOT of 1 is 0, and NOT of 0 is 1.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p>For example, performing a NOT operation on the right most bit of the binary number 111
    <b>flips the target bit</b> and results in 110.</p>
    <p>In what follows, it will be convenient to represent the state of a system by listing all possible states and placing a blue disk next to the current state.</p>
    <p>
        Click the button labelled &ldquo;<em>Not bit<sub>a</sub>&rdquo;</em>
        to apply the NOT operation to the left bit,
        and click the button labelled &ldquo;<em>Not bit<sub>b</sub>&rdquo;</em>
        to apply the NOT operation to the right bit:

        There is nothing quantum mechanical about these first few interactive examples.
        Their main purpose is to get you used to this style of presentation.

    <h1>Random NOT</h1>
    <p><em>Random NOT</em>: A NOT operator that has a specified chance of flipping a bit.</p>
    <p>Although not very common, it is still <b>just a classical (non-quantum) operator</b>.</p>
    <p>
        Consider applying a &ldquo;Random NOT&rdquo; twice to a bit whose initial value is 0,
        where the NOT has, for instance, a 30% chance of flipping the bit.
        What is the probability of the final state being 0?
    </p>
    <p>There are two paths leading to a final state of 0:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            0 &rarr; 0 &rarr; 0 with probability of 0.7 x 0.7 = 0.49
            <span class="help">
                When I write &ldquo;x &rarr; y &rarr; z&rdquo;,
                I mean &ldquo;the qubit starts with a value x,
                the first Random NOT results in the qubit having the value y,
                and the second Random NOT results in the qubit having the value z&rdquo;.
            </span>
        </li>
        <li>
            0 &rarr; 1 &rarr; 0 with probability of 0.3 x 0.3 = 0.09
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>And so the final state will be 0 with a probability of 49% + 9% = 58%</p>

    <h1>Random NOT (animated)</h1>
    <p>Next we provide an interactive animation of the Random NOT operator.</p>
    <p>The blue disk now splits in two so that we can track the different possible outcomes.</p>
    <p>The probability of being in a state is represented by the radius of the disk.</p>

        Press the &ldquo;Random NOT&rdquo; button multiple times and

<h1>Measurement</h1>
    <p>
        We have seen how a random NOT operator can
        cause a conventional computer to have various probabilities
        of being in different states.
        Of course
        <b>in reality it is in only one of those states</b>.
        We just don't know which one.
        Strangely, this is an assumpution about reality that we will need to reconsider
        later in this article.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you peek at the system to determine its actual state,
        then the probabilities all <em>collapse</em>
        so that one state has a probability of 1,
        and all the others have a probability of 0.
    </p>
    <p>
        Remember, the larger the blue disk,
        the more likely the system will turn out to be in that state.
    </p>
    <p>
        In quantum computing,
        the word <em>meausurement</em> refers to this act of peeking.
    </p>
    <p>
        Press the &ldquo;Random NOT&rdquo; button multiple times
        and then press the &ldquo;measurement&rdquo; button.
    </p>
    <p><small>
        Note that there is still nothing quantum mechanical about this yet.
        That comes next!

<h1>Hadamard of 0</h1>
    <p>The Hadamard is a special <em>quantum</em> operator that can be applied to qubits.</p>
    <p>
        <b>Warning:</b> this first look at quantum operators will be pretty boring.
        I promise it will get exciting soon.
    </p>
    <p>As you will see below, the Hadamard initially seems like a Random NOT with 50% chance of success.</p>
    <p><small>
        In this interactive example,
        I purposely disable the Hadamard button after you press it.
        Later in this article we will see what happens when you apply the Hadamard twice in a row.

<h1>Phase</h1>
<p>
    Confused?
    You should be if this is all new to you. 
    Please hang in there for a while longer.
</p>
<p>
    The arrow directions represent what physicists call <em>phase</em>:
    <ul>
        <li>it is an abstract concept of quantum mechanics.</li>
        <li>it has no &ldquo;common sense&rdquo; interpretation.</li>
        <li>it can <b>only be measured indirectly</b>.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    In the case of nuclear spin,
    phases can be manipulated by applying electric and/or
    magnetic fields.
</p>
<p>
    We will see the importance of phase in a moment,
    but first let's look at another interesting quantum computing operator...

<h1>T Operator</h1>
    <p>The T operator rotates the phase of 1, but leaves 0 untouched.</p>
    <p>Note how it does not affect the probabilities at all.</p>

<h1>Measurement Revisted</h1>
    <p>Recall:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Measurement causes the system to collapse to a single state.</li>
        <li>The larger the blue disk, the more likely the system will collapse to that state.</li>

            For the maths to work,

<section>
    <h1>What is going on here?</h1>
    <p>
        Consider a qubit that is initially known to definitely be in a 0 state.
        If you were to apply the Hadamard to it twice in a row,
        then there are four equally likely scenarios:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>0 &rarr; 0 &rarr; 0</li>
        <li>0 &rarr; 0 &rarr; 1</li>
        <li>0 &rarr; 1 &rarr; 0</li>
        <li>0 &rarr; 1 &rarr; 1</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
        So the final state should be equally likely to be 0 or 1,
        and this is exactly what happens if you peek at
        the intermediate and final states.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        If you do not peek at the intermediate state then something truely weird happens:
        <b>
            the two different scenarios ending in a 1 state have opposite phases
            and so they cancel each other out.
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        This process of phases causing possible outcomes to cancel or re-enforce
        is what physicists call <em>interference</em>.
    </p>

<h1>Superposition</h1>
<p>
    Hopefully by now you understand that,
    when a quantum computer has various probabilities
    of being in different states,
    <b>you can no longer assume that it is in reality only in one of those states</b>.
    The quantum computer is said to be in a <em>superposition</em> of
    those different states.

    <h1>
        It gets even more interesting when you have more than one qubit
    </h1>
    <p>
        You can't do anything very interesting with one qubit except perhaps use it to model
        the <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment">Double Slit Experiment</a></em>.
    </p>

        The quantum weirdness rises to a whole new level when there are two or more qubits interacting.
